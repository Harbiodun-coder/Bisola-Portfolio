      <p>
      Hi, I’m Bisola Oluwanisola Praise, a 25 years old data analyst graduated from Lagos state university with a deep love for numbers and a passion for uncovering meaningful insights.
My journey with numbers started long before I even knew what data analytics was. As a child, every car ride became an opportunity for mental math—I would count the number of houses, track how many were painted a certain color, and tally mango and orange trees along the way. It wasn’t just a game; it was my way of making sense of the world through patterns and numbers. Growing up, I realized that my fascination with numbers wasn’t just a passing habit, it was a passion waiting to be explored.
With my  background in Guidance and Counseling Psychology, I have combined my understanding of human behavior with my analytical mindset to transform raw data into meaningful insights. I believe data analysis isn’t just about numbers—it reflects real people, behaviors, and decisions. This perspective has allowed me to go beyond surface-level analysis, ensuring I understand the problem, clean the data effectively, communicate insights clearly, and implement data-driven strategies that drive real impact.In my recent projects, I have applied behavioral data analysis to group customers based on preferences leading to an exceptional percentage in engagement 
I thrive on making data accessible, actionable, and impactful. If you’re looking for a data-driven problem solver with a deep understanding of human behavior, I’d love to collaborate and discuss how I can contribute to your team’s success. Let’s connect and explore how data can shape the future!
